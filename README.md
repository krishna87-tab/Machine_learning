Predictive Health Insurance Model for Shield Insurance

Project Overview
AtliQ AI is developing a Predictive Health Insurance Model for Shield Insurance to estimate health insurance premiums 
based on key factors such as age, smoking habits, BMI, and medical history. The project consists of two phases:

Phase 1 (MVP): Build and deploy a predictive model along with a Streamlit application for insurance underwriters.
Phase 2: Develop the infrastructure for Straight-Through Processing (STP) of insurance quotes (detailed planning to be done later).

Phase 1: MVP Development
Objectives:

Develop a high-accuracy predictive model (>97% accuracy).
Ensure the percentage difference between predicted and actual values is <10% for at least 95% of predictions.

Deploy the model in the cloud for rePredictive Health Insurance Model for Shield Insurance
